# BetterdataLabs

> Privacy-first synthetic data engineering

BetterdataLabs is the research and engineering organization behind **Betterdata**.  
We build production-grade systems for **synthetic data**, **privacy-preserving AI**, and **secure data sharing**.

All repositories here are **private by design** — our **thinking is public**.

## Why BetterdataLabs?

Real-world data is:

- fragmented  
- sensitive  
- regulated  
- hard to share  
- expensive to govern  

Yet modern **AI, analytics, and experimentation depend on data access**.

BetterdataLabs exists to make data **usable without exposing real people**.

This enables:

- privacy-safe AI development  
- cross-border collaboration under strict regulations  
- faster experimentation without compliance friction

## What we work on

> Our code is private, but our problem space is not.

### Synthetic data
- relational and multi-table generation  
- time-series and event synthesis  
- high-fidelity statistical behavior  
- privacy-aware pipelines  

### Evaluation and metrics
- distributional similarity  
- temporal dynamics and trend preservation  
- relational structure integrity  
- privacy risk and leakage signals  

### Platform and infrastructure
- cloud, on-prem, and air-gapped deployments  
- Kubernetes-first orchestration  
- secure data pipelines and storage  

### Privacy and compliance engineering
- privacy-by-design architectures  
- PII detection, anonymization, and redaction  
- enterprise compliance workflows  
- controlled and auditable data access

## Why everything is private

We work with **regulated enterprises**, including:

- financial services  
- telecommunications  
- IoT and wearables  
- public sector  

To protect customers, IP, and trust:

- production repositories are private  
- access is tightly controlled  
- security reviews are mandatory  

This organization is a **window into how we think**, not how we ship.

## How we build

We optimize for:

- correctness over shortcuts  
- reproducibility over demos  
- security over convenience  
- engineering rigor over hype  

We actively explore:

- synthetic data and generative modeling research  
- scalable data engineering patterns  
- practical MLOps in constrained environments  
- privacy-preserving system design  

---

## Collaboration

We collaborate selectively with:

- enterprise teams  
- academic researchers  
- cloud and platform partners  

If you’re interested in:

- research collaboration  
- technical partnerships  
- synthetic data evaluation  
- privacy-first data systems
